# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify breast tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using a public dataset.  
The goal of this project is to understand the end-to-end machine learning workflow.

## Dataset
- sklearn Breast Cancer Dataset  
- Contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass

## Algorithm
- Logistic Regression

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab

## Workflow
1. Load the dataset
2. Perform data preprocessing
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train the Logistic Regression model
5. Evaluate model performance using accuracy

## Results
- Model achieved good accuracy on the test dataset
- Used accuracy score for evaluation

## Platform
This project was developed using **Google Colab**, which made experimentation and execution easier without local setup.

## Conclusion
This project helped me gain hands-on experience with machine learning fundamentals, data handling, and model evaluation.
